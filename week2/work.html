<h1>My goals/How I Work</h1>
<p>I want to learn more about HTML, CSS, and PHP. I love programming, and since<br>
 these languages are more for markup and less for operations I wanted to get a feel for them.</p> 
<p> I work in different ways when developing a site. I used to own a website, so I<br>
 used Joomla, which required very little coding. However, it did require some SQL management <br>
 as well as a bit of PHP (mainly modifying code). I am not super creative, so I don't often go <br>
 out of my way to make a site super flashy. In my personal opinion, a site should <br>
 just get straight to the facts -however, it should be easy to navigate, and intuitive.</p>
<h1>About me </h1>
<p>My name is Trevor Linet, and I’m a senior at Michigan State University. I am studying <br>
Computer Science, with a cognate (minor) in Telecommunications. I am from the Detroit area <br>
but I live in East Lansing year round. </p>
<h1>Rig Specs</h1>
<p>I have :<br>
 - 6 core CPU (AMD Phenom II X6 1050T ) over-clocked, and water-cooled<br>
- GTX 470 GPU<br>
- 4GB DDR3  RAM<br>
- Windows 7 Ultimate/Ubuntu</p>
<h1>What do I do for  fun</h1>
<p>I enjoy hanging out with my friends the most –doing whatever.  I really enjoy video games,<br>
 playing online with others, or offline consumed by the story and plot. I also enjoy surfing <br>
 the internet, computer programing, and experimenting with software and hardware. I like diagnosing <br>
 and fixing computers, as I have been doing it my entire life.
