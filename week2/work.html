<h1>My goals/How I Work</h1>
<p>I want to learn more about HTML, CSS, and PHP. I love programming, and since these languages are more for markup and less for operations I wanted to get a feel for them. I work in different ways when developing a site. I used to own a website, so I used Joomla, which required very little coding. However, it did require some SQL management as well as a bit of PHP (mainly modifying code). I am not super creative, so I don't often go out of my way to make a site super flashy. In my personal opinion, a site should just get straight to the facts -however, it should be easy to navigate, and intuitive.</p>

<h1>What do I do for  fun</h1>
<p>I enjoy hanging out with my friends the most –doing whatever.  I really enjoy video games,
 playing online with others, or offline consumed by the story and plot. I also enjoy surfing
 the internet, computer programing, and experimenting with software and hardware. I like diagnosing<br>
 and fixing computers, as I have been doing it my entire life.
