        <p>I am currently a Senior a Michigan State university. I am studying computer science, with a cognate (minor) in Telecommunications. I hope to go into some sort of programming career after I graduate. Michigan State University is a great place to be. I live here year round, and the people are just the best. </p>

	      My Background</h1>
			<p>My name is Trevor Linet, and I was born in the summer of 1993 in Southfield, Michigan. I grew up at home with both of my parents, as an only child. Most of my family lives out of state, but I get to see them 
          a couple times a year. Both of my parents are computer programmers, so my interest in computers has been a long-standing one. </p>
          
          <h1 class="title" id="music"><br>
          Music</h1>
          <p>I like a very wide variety of music, in a number of genres. I enjoy the music of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_%28band%29">Nirvana</a> very much - my favorite album by them is "Nevermind". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica">Metallica</a> is another band that I really enjoy too -The black album is my favorite of theirs. Last, is my favorite band of all time:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_%28Band%29">Queen</a>. Freddy Mercury had one of the best singing voices the world will ever know. I enjoy a lot of other types of music, but these are just a few that I thought of off the top of my head. I also enjoy Rap, Metal, Alternative, and more genres! </p>
         
          <h1 class="title" id="hobby"><br>
          Hobbies</h1>
          <p> In my spare time, I enjoy relaxing. When inside, I tend to play a lot of videogames. I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto, and Halo too. If I'm not playing games, then I'm watching TV shows with friends. I mainly enjoy commedies, cartoon or real actors either is fine. When I'm outside, I enjoy fishing and kayaking. My parents and I sometimes go out on the lake and just paddle around for a few hours, which is very relaxing. </p>
