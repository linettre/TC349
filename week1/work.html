<h1>About me </h1>
My name is Trevor Linet, and I’m a senior at Michigan State University. I am studying Computer Science, with a cognate (minor) in Telecommunications. 
<h1>Rig Specs</h1>
<p>I have :</p>
 - 6 core CPU (AMD Phenom II X6 1050T ) overclocked, and water-cooled<p>
- GTX 470 GPU<p></p>
- 4GB DDR3  RAM<p></p>
- Windows 7 Ultimate/Ubuntu 
<h1>What do I do for  fun</h1>
I enjoy hanging out with my friends the most –doing whatever.  I really enjoy video games, playing online with others, or offline consumed by the story and plot. I also enjoy surfing the internet, computer programing, and experimenting with software and hardware. I like diagnosing and fixing computers, as I have been doing it my entire life. 

<h1>My goals</h1>
I want to learn more about HTML, CSS, and PHP. I love programing, and since these languages are more for markup and less for operations I wanted to get a feel for them.
