        <h2>My Paper (Titlte)</h2>
        <p>In this paper, the author wanted to know if infants were rational constructive learner. Rational constructivist is a new approach to cognitive development where its the combination of constructivist development and rational learning. They believe that young children that some kind of learning mechanism that allows them to learn so fast and so well. They think children are rational, where they take what they already know and apply it to their environment. This question is important to them because they want to understand the early learning in infants and the origins of knowledge.</p>
